### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### :man: About

I am a Software Engineer with many years of experience. Software engineering is not only my daily job but also my main interest. I have a professional attitude and despite improving during every day of work I also try to extend my knowledge in my spare time. The business value is most important for me, so I focus mainly on modeling business logic and solving specific domain problems with proper tools. Programming languages, technologies, etc. are not a barrier for me. I like to share knowledge with others by writing on my blog or sometimes giving presentations.
